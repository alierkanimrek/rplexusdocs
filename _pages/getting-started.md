### Overview
Rplexus is based on a very simple philosophy.

Rplexus is a central server between devices. In Rplexus terminology, each client is called Node and they connect to the server with a client software. So multiple client software can run on one device.

**Node = Client**

Each Node and its data are defined by the user from the rplexus.net web interface. In Rplexus terminology, each data is called Task and carries data such as variable_name = "value". You can write the codes that get this data from sensors or use the libraries developed by the community.

**Task = Variable Name**

The Rplexus server redirects data from clients to the user's web interface or other shared clients. With shared node tasks you can establish a network.

You can configure this network to set up your smart home system and manage your network from any web browser.
